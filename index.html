        <section class="projects">
            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>C++ Game Projects:</strong> Fully functional chess, tic-tac-toe, and hangman games written in C++.</li>
                <li><strong>FSU Student Calendar App:</strong> Lead developer on a team creating a calendar app for FSU students, integrating with Canvas to import class schedules and deadlines. The app features an OCR-based image recognition system that extracts event details from images and automatically adds them to the student calendar. It syncs with FSU’s websites to ensure accurate and up-to-date event tracking. Developed in C# for future publication on Apple’s App Store and Google Play.</li>
                <li><strong>Shopping App with a Functional UI and Database:</strong> A .NET MAUI Application with SQL database that mimics Amazon, offering a frontend and backend written in C#. The app had an interactive mode where customers could shop from a database, and another mode for employees so that they could manage the database.</li>
                <li><strong>E-Commerce Website with SQL Database:</strong> Designed and implemented a fully functional e-commerce website using Python and HTML, integrated with an SQL database. Features include user authentication, product listings, a shopping cart, and order processing, providing a seamless online shopping experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Structures Project:</strong> Built my own version of a fully functional Linked List class in C++ (including an iterator and const_iterator), as well as classes for the Binary Search Tree, Heap, Queue, and Dequeue.</li>
                <li><strong>Assembly Code Number Conversion Project:</strong> MIPS Assembly program converting any number to its binary and hex value equivalents.</li>
                <li><strong>To-Do List Shell Script:</strong> Shell script for task management in Linux, which sorts and organizes to-do list items based on importance.</li>
                <li><strong>Handwritten Digit Recognition with Neural Networks:</strong> Developed deep neural networks in Python using PyTorch to classify handwritten digits from a dataset (7291 training samples, 2007 validation samples). Applied regularization and optimization techniques to enhance performance, achieving strong generalization on the validation set of 2007 samples.</li>
                <li><strong>Transformer-Based Analog and Sentiment Analysis:</strong> Utilized token embeddings and sentence representations from a BERT model to solve analogy problems and perform sentiment analysis. Implemented tokenization and averaged embeddings for multi-token words, achieving accurate results in both tasks.</li>
            </ul>
